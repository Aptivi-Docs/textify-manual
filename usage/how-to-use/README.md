# How to use

This library contains a plethora of features that allow you to manipulate with or generate text. They are intended to improve your productivity and accelerate your text generation.

For general usage of the text manipulation library, you can use the `TextTools` class to get access to various string manipulators. This class is found in the `Textify.General` namespace. Additionally, the JSON tools can be found in the `JsonTools` class to get access to various JSON tools, such as getting a difference between two JSON objects.

In addition to the general text tools, you can also use the regular expression tools found under the `Textify.Tools` namespace. This is all explained in their separate pages by consulting the appropriate page found in the below page:

{% content-ref url="basic-features/" %}
[basic-features](basic-features/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

For extra features that Textify provides, consult the below page:

{% content-ref url="extra-features/" %}
[extra-features](extra-features/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
