# Basic Features

In Textify, we have some of the basic text manipulation features, such as string extensions that allow you to perform various operations on a string, such as splitting new lines, splitting with double quotation support, and performing bulk replacement of substrings in a string. We also provide you with regular expression tools that allow you to interact with the [`Regex`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.regularexpressions.regex?view=net-8.0) class found in .NET.

The main focus for Textify is string manipulation, but also includes extra basic features that you can use, such as JSON tools and regular expression tools. Extensions that focus on the main goal are written in its own separate page, while the other features are mentioned in a separate page, which you can consult here:
