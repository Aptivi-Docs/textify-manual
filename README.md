# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to Textify! It's a C# library that allows you to manipulate with text in an efficient way. It not only provides you with text manipulation tools, but it also provides you with text analysis tools and VT sequence tools.

To use this library, go to any page in the left side of the screen.

## Installation

This library is very easy to install. It's available at [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpecProbe/). Just follow these steps:

1. Open your project file (`.csproj` or `.fsproj`)
2. Place the `PackageReference` line on a property group like so:
   * `<PackageReference Include="Textify.Offline" Version="x.x.x" />`
   * `<PackageReference Include="Textify.Data.Analysis" Version="x.x.x" />`
   * ...where `Version` is the current version of the library
3. Run a package restore using `dotnet restore`

If you follow these steps correctly, you should be able to use Textify functions.
